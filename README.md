Hi!
This is Sanjid from EEE-22 of KUET.In this repository I would be uploading the codes and tasks we did in "CSE -2132" course of Sessional on Computer Programming and Algorithms.We will be using C++.

##beware of the lab tests ðŸ˜•..They are not that hard unless you don't practice.
The first one would be on OOP and the other one will be about DSA.
you'll be asked to make a system that takes input using class and construcotr and returns maximum or second maximum4

DSA can be a little tricky,,,you'll be asked to take stack,modify a bit 
or an array to sort,to insert element in specified position,to apply some sorting techniques....That's alll
